# DynamicPlanner

This dynamic planner showcases some of the skills that I learned while completing the Full Stack Developer curriculum at The University of Central Florida. 

This easy, dynamic planner allows the user to save appointments, activities and other important events. Each event is uniquely color coded and will continue to render even after the page has reloaded.
